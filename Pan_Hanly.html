<div class="text1">
  <p>Step into the vibrant and compelling world of Pat Hanly (1932-2004), one of New Zealand's most significant and beloved modern artists. "Pat Hanly: The Luminous Life" offers an expansive journey through the multifaceted career of a painter renowned for his dazzling use of colour, his profound humanism, and his unwavering commitment to social and environmental causes</p>
  <p>From his early figurative works influenced by his time in Europe, capturing the energy of London's nightlife, to his distinctive "Figures in Light" series that bathed subjects in a unique New Zealand luminosity, Hanly's artistic evolution is a testament to his boundless creativity and technical prowess. This exhibition showcases his extraordinary ability to infuse his canvases with a "molecular" energy, where dynamic brushstrokes and audacious colour palettes create a sense of pulsating life.</p>
  <p>Beyond his aesthetic brilliance, Hanly was a deeply engaged artist, using his platform to voice concerns that resonated deeply with New Zealand's identity. Explore his powerful "protest art," particularly his anti-nuclear works, which utilized a visual language of striking icons to advocate for peace and a nuclear-free Pacific. You'll also encounter his tender expressions of love and connection, his fascination with boats as symbols of hope and change, and the raw, spirited improvisation of his later works.</p>
  <p>"Pat Hanly: The Luminous Life" brings together key paintings and prints from private collections and public institutions, offering a comprehensive overview of an artist whose work remains as relevant and resonant today as it was during his lifetime. This is an essential exhibition for anyone seeking to understand the heart and soul of New Zealand modernism.</p>
